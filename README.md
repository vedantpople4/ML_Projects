# The ML_Projects
->The Repo contains projects done during the course Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢ Hands-On Python & R In Data Science on Udemy. 
1. The FIFA 19 project file takes 2 teams input and then predicts the team with better overall. 
2. The DMT file uses the MNIST dataset for implementing PCA and then classify the data using 5 classifiers and also uses ICA components. The methods used are Fast ICA, truncated SVD, PCA and t-SNE. 
3. The intrusion detection model uses the data set provided to classify the data using Logistic regression and Support vector machines. Various hyper parameters and kernels are used for the models.

All Datasets used can be found on the link below:
